# BGP-BADASS-
BGP - BADASS (Bgp At Doors of Autonomous Systems is Simple)
This project is a practical deep-dive into network administration and BGP EVPN routing, using GNS3 and Docker to simulate network environments. It is divided into three parts:

Part 1: Set up GNS3 with custom Docker images.

Part 2: Build and explore a VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) network.

Part 3: Implement BGP with EVPN for MAC address discovery and dynamic routing.

The project aims to strengthen your understanding of advanced routing protocols and virtualized network topologies.
